# Design-simple-iCn3D-UI-for-middle-high-school-students
## Rationale
iCn3D is a product with a long history of supporting scientific requirements. As such it has an expasive nested menu system that uses a mix of common and structural biology specific terms resulting in over 500 menu items. The sheer number of menus, combined with opaque language can be confusing to scientists and daunting to students and teachers. Additionally, the user interface, being web-based, can have challenges related to the nature of running an app in a browser (mouse controls, selects, positioning, responsiveness, refreshing). The goals of this project are to: 1. identify the common operations needed for completing classroom exercises, 2. contribute protoype code for reducing the number of menus for testing, and 3. make initial recommendations for education modes of operation.  


Here are comments from High school students who tested iCn3D in January 2022

PROS:
● It’s relatively smooth performance.
● Touchscreen controls
● Customizability
● Viewing angles
● Some of the labeling is helpful

CONS:
● Fix sensitivity
● Undescriptive labels, vague (Add features to provide information about an amino acid, when you hover over one).
● Difficulty loading a structure of a gene, ongoing.
● Headers cover the structure of the genes (find ways to reconfigure the website and headers)
